## Before deploying to the Rebble App Store
1. **Build the .pbw without your dev API key**  
   Unset `OPEN_WEATHER_GRAPH_API_KEY` (or use a clean environment), then run `npm install` and `pebble build`. The postinstall script writes an empty key into `api-key-injected.js` when the env var is unset, so store users use the key they enter in the config page.
2. **Confirm no secrets are committed**  
   `src/pkjs/api-key-injected.js` and `.lock-waf_*` build files are in `.gitignore`. If `.lock-waf_linux_build` (or any lock file) was ever committed, remove it from the repo and rotate your Pirate Weather API key.
3. **Rebble submission**  
   Upload the `.pbw` from `build/` at [dev-portal.rebble.io](https://dev-portal.rebble.io/). Provide app name, description, release notes, and at least one screenshot (e.g. `screenshot.png`). See [Rebble Help – App Store submission](https://help.rebble.io/appstore-submission/).

## Development / emulator — API key injection
To use your API key without typing it in the config each time:
```bash
export OPEN_WEATHER_GRAPH_API_KEY=your_key_here
npm run inject-api-key
```
Then build and run as usual. The file `src/pkjs/api-key-injected.js` is generated and **gitignored**; do not commit it. For **release builds**, do not run `inject-api-key` (or run it with the variable unset) so the app uses the key from the configuration page.

## Emulator and logs ("Connection refused")
If `pebble install --emulator basalt --logs` (or diorite/aplite) says **Connection refused**, the tool is connecting to the emulator's log port before the emulator is ready.

1. **Install first, then attach logs**  
   Run: `pebble install --emulator basalt` (no `--logs`). Wait until the emulator window is up and the app is installed. Then run: `pebble install --emulator basalt --logs` again. The second run usually connects.
2. **Start the emulator, then install with logs**  
   Start the emulator: `pebble emu basalt` (or your target). When the emulator is fully running, in another terminal run: `pebble install --emulator basalt --logs`.

For more detail: `pebble install --emulator basalt --logs --debug-phonesim --debug`

## Safely exiting the emulator (avoid needing `pebble wipe`)
If you close the emulator window or press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal running `pebble install --emulator … --logs`, the pebble tool can end up in a bad state and you'll need `pebble wipe` before using the emulator again. To exit cleanly:

1. **Kill the emulator via the tool first** (in another terminal, from the project directory):
   ```bash
   pebble kill
   ```
   This stops both the emulator and the phone simulator and lets the tool clean up.
2. **Then** in the terminal that's running `pebble install --emulator … --logs`, press **Ctrl+C**.

If you already closed the window or hit Ctrl+C and the tool is borked, run `pebble wipe`, then you can start the emulator again with `pebble install --emulator basalt --logs`.

## Phone simulator window not opening
When you run `pebble install --emulator basalt`, the SDK normally starts the **watch emulator** (QEMU) and the **phone simulator** (pypkjs, a Python GUI). If only the watch window appears:

- **WSL / headless:** The phone simulator needs a display (e.g. X11). On WSL, set `DISPLAY` (e.g. WSLg or VcXsrv). Without a display, the phone simulator may fail to start.
- **Debug:** `pebble install --emulator basalt --debug-phonesim --debug`

**Workaround — open config in the browser:** With the **watch emulator already running**, open a second terminal and run:
```bash
pebble emu-app-config
```
That opens the app's configuration page (Clay) in your system browser. **Save** should work: this project patches `pebble-clay` so that in the emulator the config page redirects to `pebblejs://close#<data>` instead of the defunct Clay proxy. After you tap **Save**, the browser navigates to that URL and the SDK (or OS) should hand the config to the phone simulator so it gets sent to the watch. Run `npm run postinstall` or `npm install` to re-apply the Clay patch if you reinstalled dependencies.

## Clay + SDK patch (emu-app-config Save)
The Clay config page used to redirect "Save" through a proxy at clay.pebble.com, which no longer exists. This repo uses two patches so **Save** works when using `pebble emu-app-config`:

1. **Clay** (automatic): `postinstall` runs `scripts/patch-clay.js`, which patches `node_modules/pebble-clay` so that in the emulator we return a **data URI** with a placeholder `$$$RETURN_TO$$$` instead of the proxy URL.
2. **SDK** (run once): Run `python3 scripts/patch-sdk-browser.py` once after installing the pebble tool (and again if you reinstall/update it). That patches the SDK's `browser.py` so that when the config URL is a data URI, it injects `http://localhost:PORT/close?` into the HTML before opening. When you tap **Save**, the page then redirects to that URL and the SDK receives the config and sends it to the watch.

**Steps:** After `npm install`, run `pebble build` (so the .pbw contains the patched Clay), run `python3 scripts/patch-sdk-browser.py`, then start the emulator and use `pebble emu-app-config`. If Save still doesn't send config, use the injected API key for local dev.

## Testing the Clay config page in the emulator
1. Run the app in the emulator: `pebble install --emulator basalt` (or aplite/diorite).
2. In the **phone simulator** window, open the Pebble app, go to your watchface (OpenWeatherGraph), and tap **Configuration**.
3. The Clay config page should open. Enter your Pirate Weather API key and temperature units, then tap **Save**.
4. The page closes and the JS sends the settings to the watch; the watchface should then fetch weather using the new config.

If the phone window never appears, use the workaround above: run `pebble emu-app-config` to open the config in your browser. For local development you can also use the injected API key (`OPEN_WEATHER_GRAPH_API_KEY` + `npm run inject-api-key`) and skip the config page.
